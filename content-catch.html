      <h2>Bad Content Isn’t Worth Decorating</h2>

      <p>Content is the most overlooked design problem. Tight budgets get eaten up by other needs, like visual design, since it’s harder to look away from and feels more urgent.</p>

      <p>Failed content leads to loss of sales, loss of attention, and suspicion. When this happens, the chance for genuine connection is gone. You could be damaging your reputation or product by attempting content that is big on fluff and short on facts.</p>

      <p>Plus, writing for yourself is hard without someone there to bounce ideas off or do a tone check.</p>

      <h2>The Fix Isn’t Larger Than Life—We Can Do This Now, Together</h2>

      <p>The great news is that a little content help today will pay off—content is the first line of defense when solving problems. Through being as clear, helpful, and informative as possible, you can make sure you are doing your best to engage and form lasting connections.</p>

      <p>If you could have my undivided attention for a day to tackle content, what would you want to achieve together? That’s exactly what we’ll do.</p>

        <p>Joni is by far one of my favourite designers. They have a distinct
          style, but still always surprise me with their immense levels of
          creativity. I especially like their branding work which always seems to make
          my eyes smile.</p>

        <p>Joni has this almost magical skill of making web technology approachable and easier to understand. In fact, my first introduction to Joni’s work was when I was first learning Flexbox. Her CSS Flexbox Field Guide and cheat sheet was not only a delight to read—it also helped me navigate my way through the initial hurdles of learning.</p>
